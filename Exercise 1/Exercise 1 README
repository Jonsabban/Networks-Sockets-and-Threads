#Exercise 1 observations and answers

1)
I can see general information (Url, Method, status etc.), reponse headers and request headers.

2)
The picture has been added.
The Connection general header controls whether or not the network connection stays open. If the value sent is keep-alive, (it is in my example) the connection is persistent.

3)
GET / HTTP/1.1: This descripes the method used, and the version of the protocol (in this case HTTP v. 1.1).
Host: Studepoints.dk: This is the domain name of the server.

4)
Get: It adds ?firstName=&lastName=&hidden=12345678# (My input, or lack thereof + the hidden field and its value)
POST: It adds # (input is gone and the hidden field is... hidden.

The get method is sent through the URL, the Post is sent with the HTTP message body.

6)
While the HTTP protocol i stateless, it can still be programmed to locally save a "cookie" to users browser.
In this case, the servlet is setting a session-attribute called name. When I submit my name for the first time, the servlet saves the value locally. When I close the tab, and copy/paste the URL, the cookie is sent with thte requests made to the same server. Session cookies are deleted when the browser is closed however.

7)
Much like in assignment 6. cookies are saved to the local browser and sent back when revisiting the website. Permanent cookies differ from session cookies, because they stay even after the user has close their browser or pc. These cookies are instead set to expire on a specific date, or after a specific length of time (as it is in this case).
